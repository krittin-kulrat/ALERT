# ALERT
## Overview
Algorithm for Learning and Evaluation of Risks in Tumbles (ALERT) is an advanced machine learning project focused on revolutionizing fall detection through smart wearable technologies. It aims to bridge the gap between sophisticated fall detection algorithms and everyday usability in devices like Garmin and Fitbit watches.
## Objective
To develop and deploy a highly accurate machine learning model capable of real-time fall detection. The model, initially trained using Python with rich public datasets, will be converted to JavaScript format (.js) for seamless integration with popular smartwatch applications.
## Key Features
1. **Innovative Model Conversion**: Transitioning from Python-based machine learning models to JavaScript, enabling compatibility with smartwatch platforms.
2. **Smartwatch Integration**: Tailoring the algorithm for use in Garmin, Fitbit, and other popular smartwatch applications, maximizing reach and usability.
3. **Data-Driven Accuracy**: Employing public fall datasets for training, ensuring the model's effectiveness across diverse scenarios.
4. Real-Time Detection: Focusing on real-time analysis to provide immediate alerts and assistance in the event of a fall.
## Impact
ALERT is poised to significantly enhance the safety and well-being of users, particularly the elderly and those at high risk of falls. By integrating sophisticated fall detection into widely-used wearable devices, ALERT brings peace of mind to users and their caregivers.
## Technologies Used:
- **Training**: Python, Data Analysis Libraries (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- **Deployment**: JavaScript, Smartwatch Development Kits
- **Machine Learning**: Neural Network or Random Forest
