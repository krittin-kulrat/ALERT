## Overview

ALERT is an innovative machine learning initiative focused on advancing fall detection capabilities within smart wearable technologies. Its primary mission is to develop a highly accurate, real-time fall detection model, adaptable to various smartwatch platforms.

## Objective

To create a machine learning model, trained using Python on diverse public datasets, and convert it to a format suitable for implementation in different smartwatch environments. The project emphasizes the development and provision of a versatile model, rather than specific app development for each smartwatch brand.

## Key Features

1. **Cross-Platform Model Design**: Training a model versatile enough to be adapted to various smartwatch conventions and implementations.
2. **Smartwatch Agnostic**: The repository focuses on the training aspect and provides the model file, serving as a foundation for further implementation in different smartwatch ecosystems.
3. **Data-Driven Approach**: Leveraging public fall datasets for comprehensive and accurate model training.
4. **Real-Time Detection**: Ensuring the model is capable of real-time analysis for immediate fall detection.
5. **Open Source Collaboration**: Encouraging collaboration and contributions, fostering a community-driven approach to enhance and refine the model.

## Impact

By providing a robust, adaptable model, ALERT aims to contribute significantly to the enhancement of user safety across various smartwatch platforms. The project's core model can be a crucial tool in developing applications that aid in immediate fall detection and timely assistance, especially for the elderly and high-risk individuals.

## Technologies Used

- **Training**: Python, Data Analysis Libraries (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- **Deployment**: Model conversion tools for JavaScript compatibility (e.g., ONNX, ONNX.js)
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest (and potentially Neural Networks for larger datasets)

## Future Scope

ALERT envisions extending its impact by refining the model for greater accuracy, exploring integration with broader health monitoring systems, and adapting to emerging wearable technologies.
