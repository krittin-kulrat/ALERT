## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are committed to ensuring the security of the ALERT project. Even though we haven't released any versions yet, we encourage the reporting of any potential security vulnerabilities found in our ongoing development.

Here's how you can report a security issue:
1. **Where to Report**: If you believe you have discovered a potential security issue, please report it by emailing [krittin.kulrat@gmail.com]. A detailed report will help us understand and address the issue more effectively.
2. **Response Timeline: As this project is a collaborative hobby and not a full-time job for any of us, we will respond to your report as soon as possible. Our response time might vary, but we are committed to addressing all concerns with diligence and attention.
3. **Learning Process**: We are continuously learning about code security and may need additional information or clarification to fully understand the reported issue. Your patience and cooperation in this learning process are highly appreciated.
4. **Disclosure Policy**: We advocate for responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. Please refrain from publicly disclosing any issues until we have had the opportunity to investigate and address them.
5. **Acknowledgement**: Contributions to the security of the ALERT project are greatly valued. We will keep you informed about the status of your report and acknowledge your contribution in any public disclosure, unless anonymity is requested.
