# Contribution Guidelines for the ALERT Project
Welcome to the ALERT project! We value and appreciate contributions from our community. Below are the guidelines that we ask all contributors to follow to maintain a productive, collaborative, and inclusive environment.
## Code Contributions
1. **Python Standards and Automated Checks**:
   - All code must adhere to the PEP 8 style guide.
   - We use GitHub Actions to automatically check code with `pylint` and `flake8`. Ensure your submissions pass these checks.
   - To avoid delays in review, run `pylint` and `flake8` locally before submitting your code.
2. **Code Quality**:
   - Write readable, well-documented code with clear comments and docstrings
   - Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
## Testing
1. **Using `unittest` for New Tests**:
   - Add tests for any new code, ideally using Python's `unittest` framework to maintain consistency.
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request, as our GitHub Actions setup automatically runs `unittest`.
   - For any new tests, include comprehensive cases that cover the new functionality.
2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Strive to maintain or improve test coverage with each contribution.
## Documentation
1. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update documentation to reflect new features or changes.
   - Ensure clarity and correctness in all documentation.
## Pull Requests
1. **Branch Naming**:
   - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`).
2. **Focused Changes**:
   - Keep pull requests concise and related to a single issue or feature.
   - For large features, split them into smaller pull requests.
3. **Using Labels**:
   - Use labels to categorize your pull requests and issues. This helps in quick identification and sorting of topics.
   - Common labels include `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.
   - If youâ€™re not sure which labels to use, the maintainers will help categorize your submission.
1. **Review Process**:
   - Engage actively in the review process and be open to feedback.
## Communication
1. **Clear and Respectful Communication**:
    - Communicate your ideas and feedback clearly and respectfully.
    - Use GitHub issues or discussion forums for questions or discussions.
2. **Issue Reporting**:
    - Provide detailed descriptions and steps to reproduce when reporting issues.
3. **Enhancement Suggestions**:
    - Discuss enhancements or new features in an issue before implementation.

For additional guidelines on conduct, please refer to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
